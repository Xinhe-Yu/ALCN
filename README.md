## Tech Stack

**Backend**: FastAPI with Python 3.11 provides a robust REST API with automatic OpenAPI documentation and high-performance async capabilities. PostgreSQL 17 serves as the primary database with full-text search using tsvector for advanced lexicon queries. The application uses SQLAlchemy ORM with Alembic migrations for database management, while Pydantic handles data validation and serialization.

**Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.6 with React and TypeScript delivers a modern, type-safe user interface with server-side rendering capabilities. Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling with a custom archaeological theme, while the app supports internationalization with built-in translation management for multiple languages.

**Infrastructure**: Docker containerization enables consistent deployment across environments, with docker-compose orchestrating the backend services and PostgreSQL database. The frontend deploys seamlessly to Vercel with automatic CI/CD, while the backend can be hosted on any VPS with Docker support.

**Authentication & Security**: Email-based verification system using 6-digit codes eliminates password complexity while maintaining security. Role-based access control (admin, verified_translator, contributor) manages user permissions, and CORS configuration ensures secure API access from the frontend.
